# Fly a Drone with JS

This is the code used in my workshops with secondary schools to teach students how to fly a Tello
Drone with JavaScript (NodeJS, React and Socket.IO).

All tasks for the workshop can be [found on Notion here](https://laced-mercury-a79.notion.site/Drone-Workshop-bb02b91c52024a59afe3531048f7af52?pvs=4)

You will require a Tello drone to follow this workshop. [I have developed the workshop with this
Tello Device](https://m.dji.com/uk/product/tello)
